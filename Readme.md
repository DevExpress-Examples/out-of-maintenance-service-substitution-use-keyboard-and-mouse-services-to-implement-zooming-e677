# Service substitution - use keyboard and mouse services to implement zooming


<p>This example illustrates the use of XtraScheduler service substitution to implement zooming feature.  Versions 8.2 and up already have the <strong>ZoomIn</strong> and <strong>ZoomOut</strong> methods built-in, but the approach could be helpful for services other than keyboard and mouse, and features other than zooming, though.</p><p>See also <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/K18074">How to zoom in and out in the Day View using mouse wheel and Scheduler services</a></p>
